# Adidas order tracker

Python 3

Tracks multiple orders placed on adidas.co.uk when given emails and passwords. 
Insert emails and passwords into the 'logins.csv' file. I suggest you edit using something like notepad and not excel.  
Delimit the emails and passwords with a single space 
eg  
  email@domain.com password  
Once you run the script it will output the results into a file named 'output.csv'
